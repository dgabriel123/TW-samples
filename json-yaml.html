      <h1 class="spacer">Introduction to JSON</h1>

      <p>JSON, short for <em>JavaScript Object Notation</em>, is a commonly used format for storing and moving information. It is both human-readable and easily parsed by computers, making it a natural fit for the world of REST APIs.</p>

      <p>If you already have a working knowledge of JavaScript, JSON will be familiar territory, and you may <a href="#yaml">skip this section.</a> If you are new to JavaScript, read on.</p>

      <p>Consider the following example:</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  {
   <span class="yellow">"songs"</span>: {
    <span class="yellow">"Kashmir"</span>: <span class="yellow">"Led Zeppelin"</span>,
    <span class="yellow">"Taxman"</span>: <span class="yellow">"The Beatles"</span>,
    <span class="yellow">"Satisfaction"</span>: <span class="yellow">"The Rolling Stones"</span>
   }
  }</code>
      </pre>

      <p>All JSON objects are nested inside a set of curly brackets.  From this example, we can surmise the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>This example contains one object, titled <code class="yellow">songs</code></li>
        <li><code class="yellow">songs</code> contains 3 <em>key-value</em> pairs, which include the song name and the original recording artist</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Key-value pairs are the drivers of JSON’s data architecture. In fact, <code class="yellow">songs</code> is the first key-value pair in this example, and contains 3 pairs inside it.</p>

      <p>In JSON, the value is allowed to be 6 types of values: a string, a number, a boolean, an array, a nested object, or null.</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>String</td>
          <td><code><span class="yellow">"This is a string"</span>, <span class="yellow">"This is also a string"</span></code><br /><br />
            A string is a combination of characters. Because JSON strings are wrapped in double quotes, double quotes inside the string need to be escaped as such: <span class="yellow">"</span><span class="purple">\"</span><span class="yellow">"</span>.<br />
            For example:<br /><br />
            <code><span class="yellow">"He made </span><span class="purple">\"</span><span class="yellow">air quotes</span><span class="purple">"\</span> <span class="yellow">with his fingers."</span></code>            
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Number</td>
          <td><code><span class="purple">2</span>, <span class="purple">68</span>, <span class="purple">456</span></code><br /><br />
            A number does not use quotes. If you wrap a numeric value in double quotes, it becomes a string.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Boolean</td>
          <td><code><span class="purple">True</span>, <span class="purple">False</span></code><br /><br />
          A boolean is the on/off switch of programming: it can only be True or False.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Array</td>
          <td><code>[<span class="yellow">"String string"</span>, <span class="purple">44</span>, <span class="purple">False</span>]</code><br /><br/>
          An array is a list of items and is marked by straight brackets. These items can be a combination of any of the aforementioned elements, and are separated by a comma.
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Nested Object</td>
          <td><code>{<span class="yellow">"Nested object"</span>: <span class="yellow">"You can nest as many objects as you like"</span>}</code><br /><br />
          As I previously mentioned, JSON is a series of nested objects, the root object being JSON itself. You may nest as many objects as you like.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Null</td>
          <td><code><span class="purple">Null</span></code></td>
        </tr>
      </table>


      <p>A JSON object can contain any and every single one of these elements. The key must be a string, but the value can be any of the 5 elements. Let’s look at a more complex example of a JSON object:</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
{
   <span class="yellow">"guitar"</span>: {
      <span class="yellow">"style"</span>: [<span class="yellow">"acoustic"</span>, <span class="yellow">"electric"</span>],
      <span class="yellow">"strings"</span>: [<span class="purple">6</span>, <span class="purple">7</span>, <span class="purple">8</span>],
      <span class="yellow">"bridge"</span>: [<span class="yellow">"fixed"</span>, <span class="yellow">"tremolo"</span>],
      <span class="yellow">"body"</span>: [<span class="yellow">"hollow"</span>, <span class="yellow">"semi-hollow"</span>, <span class="yellow">"solid"</span>],
      <span class="yellow">"cymbal"</span>: <span class="purple">False</span>,
      <span class="yellow">"tunings"</span>: {
         <span class="yellow">"6 string"</span>: <span class="yellow">"EBGDAE"</span>,
         <span class="yellow">"7 string"</span>: <span class="yellow">"EBGDAEB"</span>,
         <span class="yellow">"8 string"</span>: <span class="yellow">"EBGDAEBF#"</span>
      }
   }
}</code>
      </pre>

      <p>This JSON example shows the data for the object <code class="yellow">guitar</code> and contains 6 key-value pairs:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code class="yellow">style</code>, <code class="yellow">strings</code>, <code class="yellow">bridge</code>, and <code class="yellow">body</code> are arrays</li>
        <li><code class="yellow">cymbal</code> is a boolean value and is set to <code class="purple">False</code></li>
        <li><code class="yellow">tunings</code> contains a nested object with 3 key-value pairs of its own: <code class="yellow">6 string</code>, <code class="yellow">7 string</code>, and <code class="yellow">8 string</code></li>
      </ul>

      <h1 id="yaml" class="spacer">Introduction to YAML</h1>.

      <p>YAML stands for <em>YAML Ain’t Markup Language</em>. It is even easier to read than JSON, and is the preferred language when working within the OpenAPI spec.</p>

      <p>JSON and YAML are used interchangeably, and can be easily converted back and forth with readily available online tools, such as <a href="https://codebeautify.org/json-to-yaml" target="_blank">JSON to YAML Converter byBeautify</a>. In this section, I will provide concurrent samples in both languages.</p>

      <p>Let’s revisit the JSON in the previous example:</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
{
   <span class="yellow">"guitar"</span>: {
      <span class="yellow">"style"</span>: [<span class="yellow">"acoustic"</span>, <span class="yellow">"electric"</span>],
      <span class="yellow">"strings"</span>: [<span class="purple">6</span>, <span class="purple">7</span>, <span class="purple">8</span>],
      <span class="yellow">"bridge"</span>: [<span class="yellow">"fixed"</span>, <span class="yellow">"tremolo"</span>],
      <span class="yellow">"body"</span>: [<span class="yellow">"hollow"</span>, <span class="yellow">"semi-hollow"</span>, <span class="yellow">"solid"</span>],
      <span class="yellow">"cymbal"</span>: <span class="purple">False</span>,
      <span class="yellow">"tunings"</span>: {
         <span class="yellow">"6 string"</span>: <span class="yellow">"EBGDAE"</span>,
         <span class="yellow">"7 string"</span>: <span class="yellow">"EBGDAEB"</span>,
         <span class="yellow">"8 string"</span>: <span class="yellow">"EBGDAEBF#"</span>
      }
   }
}</code>
      </pre>

      <p>Here is what it would look like when converted to YAML:</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
<span class="red">guitar</span>:
  <span class="red">style</span>:
    - <span class="yellow">acoustic</span>
    - <span class="yellow">electric</span>
  <span class="red">strings</span>:
    - <span class="purple">6</span>
    - <span class="purple">7</span>
    - <span class="purple">8</span>
  <span class="red">bridge</span>:
    - <span class="yellow">fixed</span>
    - <span class="yellow">tremolo</span>
  <span class="red">body</span>:
    - <span class="yellow">hollow</span>
    - <span class="yellow">semi-hollow</span>
    - <span class="yellow">solid</span>
  <span class="red">cymbal</span>: <span class="purple">False</span>
  <span class="red">tunings</span>:
    <span class="red">6 string</span>: <span class="yellow">EBGDAE</span>
    <span class="red">7 string</span>: <span class="yellow">EBGDAEB</span>
    <span class="red">8 string</span>: <span class="yellow">EBGDAEF#</span></code>
      </pre>

      <p>The syntax is not too dissimilar to JSON, and requires only a brief analysis to understand:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Quotes are optional in YAML. By default, <code class="red">"element"</code> in JSON looks like <code class="red">element</code> in YAML. There are exceptions when quotes are necessary, such as if you wish to turn a number into a string value or if you use special characters.</li>
        <li>YAML is space-sensitive and depends on line breaks to indicate object structure (known as <em>block format</em>). Required indentation is 1 or more spaces (tabs are not allowed in YAML).<br /><br />
          In this example, the value of guitar is an object containing 6 key/value pairs: <code class="red">style</code>, <code class="red">string</code>, <code class="red">bridge</code>, <code class="red">body</code>, <code class="red">cymbal</code>, and <code class="red">tunings</code>.</li>
        <li>You may also use <em>inline format</em> to save vertical space. Inline format looks almost identical to JSON, minus the required quotes. For example: the <code class="red">style</code> object is represented as<br /><code class="red">style: [acoustic, electric]</code></li>
        <li>Dashes represent list items, also  known as arrays. Just as in JSON, objects and arrays are frequently nested inside each other.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 class="spacer">More YAML Tricks</h1>

      <h2>Comments</h2>

      <p>YAML comments begin with # tags.</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
# Insert comment here</code>
      </pre>

      <h2>Anchors</h2>

      <p>YAML anchors are similar to variables in programming. When you set a value to a key, you may anchor it as well. That allows you to use that value later on in the file. Take a look at the following example, in which <code class="red">id</code> has a complicated value.</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  <span class="red">user</span>:
    <span class="red">name</span>: <span class="yellow">Prince Harry</span>
    <span class="red">id</span>: <span class="red">&</span><span class="green">id_harry</span> <span class="purple">5466784563474</span></code>
      </pre>

      <p>The value is long and difficult to remember. When you prepend the value of <code class="red">id</code> with <code class="red">&</code><code class="green">id_harry</code>, You set that value to the much more easily remembered <code class="green">id_harry</code>. You may then call upon it later in the document as such:</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  <span class="red">Harry</span>:
    <span class="red">id</span>: <span class="red">*</span>id_harry</code>
      </pre>

      <p>The asterisk marks the reference to the anchor that was set above.</p>

      <h2>References</h2>

      <p>The final important YAML element to learn for OpenAPI is <code class="red">$ref</code>. <code class="red">$ref</code> is used to reference files outside the current YAML file.</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
<span class="red">$ref</span>: <span class="yellow">"#/assets/images/Harry.jpg"</span></code>
      </pre>

      <p>The filepath of the file can be local, remote, or a URL.</p>

      <p>Note: There is a limitation to where you are allowed to insert <code class="red">$ref</code> in your OpenAPI project. More on this later.</p>
